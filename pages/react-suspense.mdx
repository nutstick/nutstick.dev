Just like you can do asynchronous render

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <React.Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
    <ProfileDetial />
    <CommentList />
  </React.Suspense>
);
```

`React Suspense` is a React component that waits for all children components to become ready before rendering, and it will display a `fallback` component while waiting.

The main application of Suspense is

- Code splitting
- Data fetching
- Concurrent mode

It is important to note that `Suspense` is neither a data-fetching library nor a new way to manage a state. **It simply prevents your components from rendering until all asynchronous tasks are completed**.

## How does Suspense work internally?

First, let's take a look at the example of how to use suspense with data fetching

```tsx
const resource = fetchUserInfo();

function ProfilePage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading profile...</h1>}>
      <ProfileDetails />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function ProfileDetails() {
  // Try to read user info, although it might not have loaded yet
  const user = resource.read();
  return <h1>{user.name}</h1>;
}
```

This code might confuse all of us as React developers because, with Suspense, we look like we are allowed to use data that retrieve asynchronously just like it's synchronous.

It's actually what Suspense try to achieve “just like you write asynchronously rendering component”

The magic behind `Suspense` is they are allowed to notify components to tell React that they are not ready by **throwing a Promise**. By that `Suspense` can use the same mechanism `ErrorBoundary` to catch an error that is being thrown, and after Promise resolves, React will come back to render that component.

```tsx
// Suspense integrations like Relay implement
// a contract like this to integrate with React.
// Real implementations can be significantly more complex.
// Don't copy-paste this into your project!
export default function createResource() {
  let status = 'loading';
  let result;
  let suspender = fetchUser().then(
    (data) => {
      status = 'success';
      result = data;
    },
    (error) => {
      status = 'error';
      result = error;
    }
  );

  return {
    read() {
      if (status === 'loading') {
        throw suspender;
      } else if (status === 'error') {
        throw result;
      } else if (status === 'success') {
        return result;
      }
    },
  };
}
```

## What's different between `Suspense` and naive `useState` + `useEffect`?

As a React developer, Loading state UI is what we always need to deal with. And since it's not a new issue, we already have many ways to deal with it. The most naive way to do this is simply to use `useState` + `useEffect` combo

> Is React team just trying to introduce a new pattern of how the loading state should be handled?

Nope!

The major difference between Suspense and your friendly neighborhood solution is Suspense introduces a concept of **render as you fetch**

If we try to group the fetching pattern in React. We are able to group it into 3 approaches

### Render then fetch

fetching in `useEffect`. Each component will trigger data fetching within `useEffect`.

```tsx
function ProductPage() {
  const [item, setItem] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct().then((p) => setItem(p));
  }, []);

  return item == null ? (
    <Loader />
  ) : (
    <>
      <ProductInfo item={item} />
      <RecommendItems />
      <NavBar />
    </>
  );
}

function RecommendItems() {
  const [recommendItems, setRecommendItems] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchRecommendItems().then((items) => setRecommendItems(items));
  }, []);

  return recommendItems == null ? (
    <h2>Loading items...</h2>
  ) : (
    <List data={recommendItems} />
  );
}
```

Results

**Pro**

- Encapsulated - fetch logic is handled within the component

**Con**

- Slow final result - Because of waterfall requests
- Loading UI - When there are multiple `RecommendItems`, it is hard to guarantee which one will load first which makes Loading UI very inconsistent.

### Fetch then render

preload, the Parent component will prepare (fetching) all the data when the data is ready, render children. We can't do anything until the data arrives.

```tsx
function ProductPage() {
  const [item, setItem] = useState(null);
  const [recommendItems, setRecommendItems] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct().then((p) => setItem(p));
    fetchRecommendItems().then((items) => setRecommendItems(items));
  }, []);

  return item == null ? (
    <Loader />
  ) : (
    <>
      <ProductInfo item={item} />
      <RecommendItems />
      <NavBar />
    </>
  );
}

function RecommendItems({ recommendItems }) {
  return recommendItems == null ? (
    <h2>Loading items...</h2>
  ) : (
    <List data={recommendItems} />
  );
}
```

Results

**Pro**

- Solve waterfall requests that happen in Render then fetch
- Easier to handle loading state

**Con**

- Maintainable - Parent component (ProductPage in this example) will need to account for every logic in the page
- Performance risk - Add extra render to parent, the risk to cause unnecessary re-render.

## Render as you fetch

Using Suspense with data fetching

```tsx
function ProductPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
      <ProductInfo />
      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading items...</h2>}>
        <RecommendItems />
      </Suspense>
      <NavBar />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function ProductInfo() {
  const item = itemResource.read();

  return <... />
}

function RecommendItems() {
  const recommendItems = recommendItemsResource.read();
  return (
    <List data={recommendItems}/>
  );
}

```

Results

![Render as you fetch result](/react-suspense/render-on-fetch.png)

With `Suspense` approach, you can achieve

- Fetch while rendering - We can perform fetch **before components even render**
- Encapsulate - fetching logic will still handle within the component. After fetch is completed, React will only render that component.
- Chances to rearrange task priorities
  - Important content - suspended API
  - Not important - call in useEffect
- Pre-render component - When `Suspense` find suspended component, React won't bail and stop all rendering instead **React will try to render components that are not pending while you wait for those fetch to resolve**

## Ready for production?

- `Suspense` + `React.lazy` for code splitting is official by React
- `Suspense` + data fetching is not official, although it's pretty stable after React 16.6.3. And in PDP, we have used `react-freeze` that utilizes `Suspense` contract to prevent children re-render to optimize performance in production already.

But It is always recommended not to implement `wrapPromise` by yourself, better to use it via other well-maintenance libraries

There're many libraries that support `Suspense`

- [relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/rendering/loading-states/) - Client state management for GraphQL
- [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/suspense), [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/suspense) - Popular React fetching library
- [recoil](https://recoiljs.org/docs/guides/asynchronous-data-queries) - Atomic state management

## Anything I need to know before I jump right in to Suspense?

### Always read the value in a component that uses it

If we happen to move `itemResource.read()` into Page level. When we try to render `ProductPage`, it will get suspended directly. And `recommendItemsResource.read()` will never be called at first render.

Which end up similar to result in Render then fetch

```tsx
function ProductPage() {
  const item = itemResource.read();
  return (
    <>
      <ProductInfo item={item} />
      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading items...</h2>}>
        <RecommendItems />
      </Suspense>
      <NavBar />
    </>
  );
}

function RecommendItems() {
  const recommendItems = recommendItemsResource.read();
  return <List data={recommendItems} />;
}
```

It is always better to only call suspender right before where its uses, so React is able to pre-render other parts that are ready

### Sequential vs concurrent request

With this code, the API request will call sequentially

```tsx
import { useQuery } from 'react-query'

const ProductInfo = () => {
  const item = useQuery('item', () => fetchItem(), { suspense: true });
  const shop = useQuery('shop', () => fetchShop(), { suspense: true });
```

If we split the request into a separate component, it will become concurrent

```tsx
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

const Item = () => {
  const item = useQuery('item', () => fetchItem(), { suspense: true });
  return <>...</>;
};

const Shop = () => {
  const shop = useQuery('shop', () => fetchShop(), { suspense: true });
  return <>...</>;
};

const ProductInfo = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Item />
      <Shop />
    </>
  );
};
```

### Refresh with persisted data

Unlike casual React we persist the latest value in state. `Suspense` utilizes `Promise` to hold the value. When we re-fetch the request, we will get another promise that will lead to `fallback` component being shown again.

There're several workaround depending on which library you used. But it requires involving `useState` and lazily calling `setState` to refresh the data

This issue might be solved completely in [React Concurrent mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.html#transitions-are-everywhere), as `startTransition` is deeply integrated with Suspense which allows us to show `fallback` again while the component is loading data

### `useEffect` behavior

If you start using Suspense in Legacy mode. You might need to be aware of the behavior of `useEffect` that could trigger earlier than you expected

For example, if `ComponentThatSuspends` and `Sibling` render within same Suspense, and Sibling is component doesn't pending any data

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <ComponentThatSuspends />
  <Sibling />
</Suspense>
```

While waiting for `ComponentThatSuspends` to be ready, React will render and mount `Sibling` to DOM since it's ready first with inline style `display: none` to hide it. And React will trigger `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect` even `fallback` component still showed.

This is the behavior of Legacy Suspense as described in [https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/7](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/7).

And this behavior will change in Blocking and Concurrent mode. As React won't commit inconsistent state into DOM.

## That's a Wrap

This should cover all basic of `Suspense` and how it's worked, to get you understand and able to adopt in your application in future.
